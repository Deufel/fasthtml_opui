structure for setting up the appplication to use; - [Open Props CSS
Custom Variables](https://open-props.style/) - [Open Props
UI](https://open-props-ui.netlify.app/)

This is a convience step and is not required if you have a different
file structure you want to use.

components in fast HTML easy.
